    <h2>Chicken fried with rice and vegetables</h2>
    <p>A <em>delicious</em> and <em>healthy</em> <strong>dinner</strong>!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 Chicken breast</li>
      <li>Rice</li>
      <li>
        1-3 cloves of garlic (depends how strong you want the garlic to taste; i
        like it strong so I use 3)
      </li>
      <li>
        Your choice of mixed vegetables (carrots, peas, peppers, mushrooms,
        etc.); if you're unsure use what we recommend :)
      </li>
      <li>2 Eggs</li>
      <li>Olive oil</li>
      <li>
        Your choice of seasoning (salt, black pepper, red cayenne pepper, etc.);
        if you're unsure use what we recommend :)
      </li>
      <li>Soy sauce</li>
      <li>Onion (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare rice. It is recommended that you do this a day in advance and
        leave it in the fridge, but you can also start it ~1 hour before you
        plan to eat.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the rice is 15 minutes from being ready (if it isn't already),
        slice your chicken into small pieces, add salt and pepper, then begin
        frying it in olive oil on medium to high heat.
      </li>
      <li>Add diced garlic and the onion (remember the onion is optional).</li>
      <li>Stir and flip the chicken and garlic regularly so nothing burns.</li>
      <li>
        When your chicken is almost ready add your vegetables and spices to the
        pan. Reduce the heat to medium.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add your eggs. You can also do your eggs on a separate pan if you don't
        have space or if you want to preserve the egg color.
      </li>
      <li>Add rice and soy sauce.</li>
      <li>Fry for an additional 5 minutes, then plate and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
